# Blender Data Generation

## Roadmap
### TODO:
* define 3 lines stages
* Option to make images look at the camera
* Option/params to scale images/+- scaling randomly
* Parameter/option file to define classes (for YOLO labeling)
* Make images "stand" on the floor
* Add background simple
* Add background from assets
* Add 3D objects
* Lights randomization, movement, etc
* Refactor code

### TODO design:
* Make general structure to define paths, type of objects/class, properties(eg: scaling), number of objects, +-positions...

### FIX:

## Acknowledgments
* [Federico Arenas LÃ³pez](https://github.com/federicoarenasl/Data-Generation-with-Blender): For providing a good base project and functions for defining bounding boxes and rendering.
